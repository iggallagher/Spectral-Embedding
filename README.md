# Spectral-Embedding

## Introduction

This package includes a variety of tools for spectral embedding of graphs, using the theory of the generalised random dot product graph and its many extensions to analyse networks. Currently, the package has functionality that can be divided into four sections:
- Network generation,
- Spectral embedding algorithms,
- Calculation of the embedding asymptotic distribution,
- Chernoff information calculations.
